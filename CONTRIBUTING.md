# Contributing to pyobis
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
    + Make sure your pull requests are in-detail and includes:
        - a good title and a summary describing the changes you made with your set of edits
        - notes for reviewers, if in case you wish to add some additional points for the reviewers to make a note of
        - whenever possible, break pull requests into smaller ones.
        - make sure the pull request should do only one thing - single objective for a single PR.

## Any contributions you make will be under this [Software License](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis/blob/master/LICENSE)
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood to be under the same [License](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can, so that *anyone* with the base python setup can reproduce. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
